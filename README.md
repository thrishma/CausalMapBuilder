# Causal Map Builder - The Artificial Facilitator
The world of Alexa has been explored to create an Artificial Facilitator who will guide a participant in developing causal maps.

Currently participants interested in developing causal models have often done it with the support of a trained facilitator, who elicits concepts and causal relations. 

In this research we are trying to replace the facilitator with Alexa to form causal maps by interacting with particiapants.
